# Nifty Dev-Tools

## Command-Line Tools

> There are plenty of CLI tools... these are the ones I end up using a great deal in my own set-up

- [**oh-my-posh** (pretty shell UI)](https://ohmyposh.dev/): Best of the bunch for me - oh my posh offers a really nice interface that plays nicely on every platform and most shell GUIs
- [**JQ** (JSON handling and manipulation)](https://jqlang.org/): JQ is a really useful little library for CLI handling of JSON. Turns a simple task like turning an HTTP response into a single variable, or a list, into a doable task in a single command.
- [**YQ** (YAML handling and manipulation)](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq): Same as JQ, but for YAML
- [**GH** (Github CLI)](https://cli.github.com/): Essential for devs these days, this should be a part of your workflow. You can automate PR creation, issue handling and see the PR's you are assigned to.
- [**Taskfile** (Command Runner)](https://taskfile.dev/): I can't tell you just how much of a godsend Taskfile is. Every command in your repo can simply can be defined in a super-friendly to read and develop with YAML file, and then run in the command line with `task my-task`. Really flexible, cross-platform. If you aren't using a library that supports defining scripts itself, I would use this every time.
- [**Alex** (Insensitive Language Checker)](https://github.com/get-alex/alex): Useful generally in pre-commit hooks to make sure your use of language is up to scratch.
- [**HTTPie** (HTTP Client)](https://httpie.io/cli): A friendlier version of CURL.
- [**lsd**](https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd): A more in depth version of ls - really useful when you need to go poking around file systems in a pinch
